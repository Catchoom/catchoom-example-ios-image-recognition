## Catchoom CraftAR - iOS Image Recognition SDK examples

### Introduction

Catchoom allows to create recognition experiences using the Catchoom CraftAR Service and the Image Recognition SDK ('Mobile SDK').

With Catchoom, you can create amazing apps that provide digital content
for real-life objects like printed media, packaging among others. You
can use our online web panel or APIs, to upload images to be recognized and set
content to display upon recognition in your Catchoom-powered app.

This document describes mainly the Examples of different uses of the Service and the SDK.
General use of the SDK can be found in the [Documentation section of Catchoom website](http://catchoom.com/documentation/sdk/ios-image-recognition-sdk/). Complete SDK documentation of the classes can be found within the SDK distribution.
